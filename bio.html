        Brandi has lived and traveled all over America. Born in Ohio, raised in North Carolina, found love in New York, learned about life in Colorado, and found a love for coding in California.<br>
        <br>
        Brandi attended The Ohio State University, majoring in History of Art and minoring in English. From there, she went on to work in textbook publishing, providing photo coordination, editing, licensing, and research for almost a decade.<br>
        <br>
        In 2011, she was introduced to computer programming. For the first time in what seemed like forever, she felt challenged and it was wonderful! Over the next few years, she worked through online tutorials and instructional courses in Ruby and Python. Eventually, it became clear to her that she needed to change careers and become a software developer.<br>
        <br>
        Brandi enjoys a lot in life, including target archery, photography, music, films, travel, and animals. She lives in the Bay Area with her boyfriend and two cats.<br>
