    This is a topic that I've been stumbling with this week, which is why I chose it. So, what is the difference between displaying inline vs block vs inline block?
    <br><br>
    As you can see in the screenshot example above, we're dealing with positioning - or placement on a document. When designing a website, the contents are coded in HTML, while the formating and positioning of the elements are coded in CSS. When you want to place elements in a column or side by side, you have to consider the "display" tag and its capabilities.
    <br><br>
    When using display, you can choose from the following. display: inline; display: block; and display: inline-block;
    <br><br>
    Inline elements respect left and right margins & padding, but cannot have a width and height. They do allow other elements to reside to their left and right. You might use this if you want your elements to flow from left to right, onto multiple lines.
    <br><br>
    Block elements respect all margins and padding, but also force a line break after the element - so no other elements can reside next to a Block element. There is always some whitespace above and below it, as well. If you want elements - such as pictures - to be positioned one on top of the other, as if in a column, choose display: block;
    <br><br>
    Inline-Block elements are a hybrid of the two other options. They respect all margins & padding, and also allow other elements to reside next to them. Basically, the inline-block element sits on the page as an inline element, but behaves as a block element. Inline-Block positioning does not create whitespace in HTML. Inline-Block is ideal when you want to have elements reside side-by-side and you want to be able to easily control the space between them.
