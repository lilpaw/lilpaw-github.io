    I don't like to waste a lot of time. I don't like to waste your time, I don't like to waste my time. So, when I ask questions, I try to be as straight and complete as possible. I set up a full scene - setting, characters, background, etc. <br>
    <br>
    I do this because of past experience. I've found that if I'm too simple or to vague with my question, I get a lot of questions in return - which can potentially lead the conversation down a rabbit hole.<br>
    <br>
    On the flip side, I've found that saying too much can also over-complicate the answer. Too much information can overwhelm the audience and they lose focus on what the real question is.
    <br> <br>
    Finding a balance is important, especially in a work scenerio - or asking questions on a tech forum.
    <br><br>
    Keep the question simple and to the point. Provide tech information (language, browser, operating system, etc.), so that the audience has the necessary materials to give you an educated answer.
    <br><br>
    When you're writing your question, keep in mind that your audience is probably busy and won't answer if your question is too dense or confusing. Again, wasting time is the worst.
    <br><br>
    Try to post your question WITHOUT posting any code. You want people to respond to your question, not immediately jump to your code and start analyzing.
    <br><br>
    I think the biggest thing to remember is that you shouldn't get discouraged if your question isn't received well or you don't receive the answer that you are looking for. Sometimes it's a matter of timing, sometimes it's a matter of wording. Just practice, practice, practice! It's another communication skill that pays to be fine-tuned.
