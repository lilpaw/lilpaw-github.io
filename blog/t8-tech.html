    Put simply, Ruby on Rails is a framework for building websites. It creates an environment that emphasises the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) philosophy and makes it easier for collaboration and maintenance. Rails is written in Ruby, but combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. With these combined, it creates a web application.<br>
    <br>
    Rails uses Ruby because of it is a streamlined, modern programming language that uses easy to follow syntax. Less code is required in Ruby to create basic structures.<br>
    <br>
    Because of the way Rails is built, there are less decisions to make and less to build from scratch when creating a new application. Rails is considered to be very "opinionated", so there are specific ways that a Rails user is supposed to create web applications. When developing within Rails, the user will find that a lot of what is needed is already been built by the framework. This can become frustrating for a beginner from time to time. A beginner wants to see how code works, but because Rails uses DRY to almost an extreme, the default behavior makes some code look like "magic" because the working code has been hidden.<br>
    <br>
    Ultimately, though, Rails provides a great way to develop quickly. The Rails "stack" can include a variety of operating systems, databases, and web servers. It can also include several software libraries - also called gems. These gems can add features to a website or even aid in development.<br>

    I look forward to learning Ruby on Rails, especially now that I've been using Ruby as my primary programming language for months. I tried to use Rails on my own, but became overwhelmed. I know it'll be a much different experience with DBC's guidance!<br>
