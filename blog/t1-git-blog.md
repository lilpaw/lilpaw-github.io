Phase 0, Week 1

Git, GitHub, and Blogging

10/30/2014

Let's do this! Week 1 has been very exciting for me. Up until now, my coding instruction has come from online tutorials and exercises. Learning to actually manipulate my computer's folders and files using the Command Line (CLI) has been completely new - and confidence inspiring. Our focus so far has been on setting up our computers (I'm a Mac gal), becoming familiar with the command line, and learning about the capabilities of git, a Version Control System.

The benefits of version control are amazing. Being able to revert back to previous versions of your work (in the case that you've accidentally introduced a bug or you're just dissatisfied with the direction your code has taken) can save a lot of time and frustration. It also allows multiple people to work on a file at the same time, which is where git comes into play.

Using git, you can track where a file is in the workflow. It's 1) being worked on, 2) waiting to be saved, or 3) changes have been saved or committed. When ready to send your changes to the main file, you "push" it to another person on your team. This allows them to see what changes have been made and go over your code one more time before they merge it with what everyone else has been working on. It's kind of like being assigned to work on the first two chapters of a book, while the rest of the chapters have been assigned to multiple other people. When your chapters are ready, you send it to one person that looks them over and decides if they are ready to become a permanent part of the overall book. When working with a group of people, this just makes sense.

GitHub is a way to store our code online and share it with others. It allows for feedback from fellow developers and your files are available remotely to be accessed by anyone, rather than just on your computer.
