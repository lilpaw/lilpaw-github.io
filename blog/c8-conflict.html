    I recently simultaneously fired and was fired by my landscaper.<br>
    <br>
    Three weeks had passed since I'd seen any improvement or cleanup in our yard, so I contacted the landscaping company owner. They reported that their men had been to the house at least once. I had no reason to be suspicious, so I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.<br>
    <br>
    The following Tuesday, I was home when the landscapers came. After they left, I went outside and took photos of our yard. Fruit, branches, and leaves were still all over the yard and left building up against the fences. Once again, it didn't look like anyone had been there. I sent the photos to the owner, simply asking him to quality check his men and to clarify what was agreed upon in our contract. He responded, "Out of 230 customers, I receive zero complaints. We are not the gardeners for you."<br>
    <br>
    My reply was simply, "If you won't even consider quality checking your men, even after seeing photos, then I definitely don't want to do business with you either."<br>
    <br>
    The source of the conflict was his unwillingness to acknowledge the validity of my complaint. My basic emotions were upset, hurt - everything that comes with being lied to and having someone deny facts to your face.<br>
    <br>
    I resolved the conflict by ending our relationship and then writing a factual review on Yelp for their business. I felt it was best to let people know how he conducts his business. I waited a few days though, so that I wasn't writing out of my emotions.<br>
    <br>
    If I could go back, I think I would have asked the owner to meet me at my property to go over everything. I feel that the coldness of email allowed him to easily dismiss me and for me to feel a lot of emotions that may not have played out if he had come to the house himself.<br>
    <br>
    I learned a lot from this experience. This was my first time hiring someone to take care of my property and I put a lot of trust (and emotions) into it. This experience taught me that I shouldn't involve my emotions so much and see it as a business transaction. I don't like that I still feel slighted after a month of this conflict. I don't wish them ill will, but I still feel a need for validation.<br>
    <br>
    In the engineering world, I know that there will be conflicts. It'll be important for me to be honest to myself about what I'm feeling and know why certain emotions are being triggered. It will help me to sort things out and approach conflicts in a professional and accepted manner, without tearing myself up inside.<br>
