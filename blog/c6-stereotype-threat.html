    I've been there. I've been in a conference room, filled with men, and realized that 1) I was the only woman, 2) I was wearing a dress, and 3) I was seated in the only chair that didn't have a high back. When it was my turn to give a status update on my projects, I fumbled with my words and did not speak with confidence. I knew, that because I was a woman, I probably shouldn't assert myself too strongly and that anything that I did or said would just amplify any ideas that they had of me just based on the fact that I am a woman. Unfairly, I considered myself a representative of all woman kind during this short, pretty insignificant meeting. That's a lot of pressure to put on yourself. And when it was my turn to perform, I fell flat on my face.

    According to Dr. Claude Steele, this is called "stereotype threat." Assuming that others will judge you based on your appearance, race, gender or age takes focus away from cognitive resources and undermines performance. Dr. Steele showed this in various studies, including one where students took a section of the GRE and minorities performed extremely less impressively when told that it would measure their intelligence, rather than told that it couldn't measure intelligence.

    To change my reaction, the only thing that I have been able to do is to empower myself through preparation before networking events and work meetings. I joined groups of women in tech and online communities where women build each other up. Having constant reminders of how capable women are gives me strength to be who I am when facing my male counterparts. Over time, I've been able to approach men of many levels and fight through my fears of being perceived as less than who I am. I have made a fool of myself on occasion, but I've brushed it off and pushed forward. I share my stories with fellow women and keep working toward a day when I will no longer think about whether I'm entering a mixed room.
