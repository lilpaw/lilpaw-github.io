  I've heard the term everywhere lately: "Net Neutrality". My friends in tech have been posting cartoons and rants about it, the talking heads on tv won't shut up about it, and here I am, about to enter the tech world, and I've no idea what it's all about.<br><br>
  Before writing this blog entry, my knowledge of network neutrality - and I'm guessing the average American - was that it should be protected or we'll have to start paying for access to the internet and everything on the internet will be censored by corporations. I needed to research this a bit to figure out what exactly has been going on and how it could affect the future of the tech world.
  <br><br>
  So, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC, formed in 1934) basically exists to regulate and give guidelines to the communications industry to keep them decent and working in the favor of the American people. They had protections in place that prevented broadband providers (like Time Warner, Comcast, etc.) from analyzing and manipulating data that is sent over the Internet. In January of this year, a court said that the FCC had overstepped their bounds. It also said that the FCC could impose stronger rules, but the FCC thinks that they may instead let Internet service providers to charge content providers for faster service to customers.
  <br><br>
  A hypothetical: Comcast could say "Hey, Netflix! Your customers want faster speed because they need to stream videos. Pay us and the Internet will work faster. If you don't pay us, we're going to slow down the speed instead..."
  <br><br>
  Another hypothetical: Time Warner could say "Hey, Candidate X! If you pay us, we'll put a stop to your competitors' emails."
  <br><br>
  I read a good summary on the ACLU site: "Imagine if the phone company could mess with your calls every time you tried to order pizza from Domino's, because Pizza Hut is paying them to route their calls first."
  <br><br>
  I know that it seems counter-intuitive, but rules need to be enforced to preserve the freedom and openness of the internet. I don't want a corporation to be in charge of what I receive and send. Small companies and organizations would be hurt by a lack of net neutrality. News about current events could be filtered by corporations. Everything that we work for could be squashed just because we're not willing to pay big money - or because our competitor is just stronger than us.
  <br><br>
  I can't help but think about Communist countries and how their citizens only see a small sliver of the internet because that's what the government wants them to see. I really don't want that to become the way of America. It truly is a First Amendment issue. People should be able to say whatever they want and for that information to be available online for anyone that wants to read it. It shouldn't be up to a third party.
  <br><br>
  I hope this sheds a little more light on the subject of Net Neutrality. It's definitely an issue that is worth watching - whether or not you're in the tech world.
