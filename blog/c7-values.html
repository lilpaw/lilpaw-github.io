    What values come to mind when I think of happiest, proudest, and most satisfying moments?<br>
    <br><b>
    - intellectual status <br>
    - inner harmony <br>
    - close relationships <br>
    - self-reliance <br>
    - accomplishment
    </b>
    <br><br>
    I would say that I try to live up to these values every day, with the most stress on self-reliance, close relationships, and accomplishment. I feel that intellectual status is just a happy benefit from accomplishing things successfully. And, inner harmony gets pushed aside from time to time in my pursuit for self-reliance and accomplishment. Close relationships give me an immense amount of satisfaction and the emotional benefits can be endless when a close relationship is successfully maintained. Knowing that I have a bond with someone is very fulfilling for me and lends a hand to my inner harmony.

    The last topic that someone asked my advice on was actually about inner harmony. They were having issues with depression resulting from not being able to achieve something quickly. I told them that I am currently trying to break myself of the habit of equating my self-worth with my abilities and accomplishments. I've been told to repeat to myself: "I am of value by myself." The person was incredulous, saying, "What if you just think that that is BS? How can you break the habit if you don't believe what you hear?" I told them that it's important to identify why they might have that disbelief - where does that feeling come from. Once that is defined, they can begin to investigate those feelings and shake their old inner beliefs to let a new, more valid belief in.
    <br><br>
    I know that this is a bit off topic, but it's something that I've been working on recently and feel very strongly about. We create our own stumbling blocks and we are the only ones that keep ourselves from feeling self-worth.

    When feeling stereotype threat, I think I can overcome it. Stereotype threat is just another old inner belief that needs to be shaken, so that you can stay focused on your true goals. By recognizing that my value is not in how I am perceived or my accomplishments, I can keep the anxiety that comes with those things at bay and be more confident and relaxed as I proceed. As I said before, we create our own stumbling blocks - and recognizing that can really free up your ability to shine.

    I know that when I am at Dev Bootcamp, I may hit some walls (maybe even literally! jk) and I may become depressed. I know that I'm going to miss my current daily activities and the people in my life. My current support system won't be available. I think my value of self-reliance will help. I also know that there is a support system built-in to the DBC program - and we are already using it with our Accountability group and on the Google + community. By building relationships with others in my cohort and recognizing when I tend to create stumbling blocks for myself, I'll have the tools I need to stay focused. Eye on the prize!
