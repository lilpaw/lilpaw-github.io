    Pre-Phase 0, I took the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style quiz</a> to determine my <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a>. I am Abstract Sequential (AS), with Abstract Random (AR) as an extremely close second. For the purposes of this post, I'll focus on the AS.
    <br><br>
    AS thinkers like to be heard, analyze situations before acting, and apply logic in solving problems. Luckily for me, I learn best in an environment like the one available at Dev Bootcamp. I'm able to work alone well, but I also learn well when I have access to resources (teachers, experts, etc) and am in a stimulating environment.
    <br><br>
    Now, let's focus on the negative: how my way of thinking may make things difficult for me at times while I'm at DBC. AS thinkers tend to want to fully understand a subject and don't deal well with being given too little time to become an expert. I've already had to deal with this at DBC. Last week, while learning CSS, I was forced to move on because of time constraints. I felt panicked, like I didn't have a firm enough grasp on the material and that my work would suffer completely because of it.
    <br><br>
    AS thinkers also don't like to do the same tasks over and over again. When learning, if I feel that I'm understanding a concept fully, I want to move on to the next topic. But, when I'm asked to stay on the same concept and do exercises in it repetitively, I can get aggrevated. I know that this is a ridiculous reaction because sometimes, I know that I benefit from practicing over and over until something becomes second nature. And, I also realize that in a classroom environment, there will be other students that benefit from different styles of learning and I just have to be patient.
    <br><br>
    I think so far, my biggest struggle at DBC has been switching to a growth mindset. It is something that I've wanted to do for years, and now, DBC is presenting me with the perfect opportunity to make that change. Going back to my example of learning CSS last week.

    <br><br>
    The topic was completely new and I didn't grasp the concepts as easily as I normally do with new material. In the past, I would have seen this as a major failure and said, "Goodbye. At least I tried." But, by keeping my goals in mind and understanding that failing is part of learning and growth, I knew that I needed to see it as a challenge to overcome and to add to my experiences. It was extremely hard for me, and frankly, it made me feel brave for pushing through and continuing. CSS is still not once of my strengths, but that doesn't mean that it won't be eventually!
    <br><br>
    So, to sum this up, my thinking style lends itself well to the learning environment at DBC and I really look forward to flexing my brain muscles as I take this huge step towards a new career. I will have to be mindful of ways my thinking style may try to hold me back and look at them as a challenge to overcome and new ways to grow.
