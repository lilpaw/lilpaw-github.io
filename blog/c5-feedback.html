    At Dev Bootcamp, we are required to program in pairs and then give each other feedback. Giving feedback was completely foreign to me. Sure, I tend to give compliments, constructive criticism, and encouragement to my coworkers and friends. But I've never been required to do so - or entered into a project knowing that I would have to do so.<br><br>
    I thought pairing was going to extremely difficult. These are all people that I've never met before and we all have different backgrounds. How are we to know how to proceed when we aren't familiar with each other's work habits? Other than the constructs that DBC gives for pairing, we're left to our own devices. Turns out, even though we're all very different, we are all pretty much on the same page. We're all learning, we're all asking questions, we're all nervous and fearful and everything that comes with starting something completely new in your career. When I pair, I'm always interested to see how my partner will approach the problem and the ideas that they'll come up with. In almost every pairing session, one of us has been helped by the other in some way. It's very rewarding to finish a challenge together.<br><br>
    I think that there are a lot of things that can be considered as frustrating, but to me, they all come with the territory. Different attitudes, different schedules, different mindsets. I've found it helpful to remind myself of this before every session and it helps me to be more patient and forgiving.<br><br>
    Given that I'm forgiving, I don't tend to see what can be left as "actionable" feedback for my pair. I've made myself aware of this and am trying to be better about noting things that can be constructive. I've had no problem with being kind and specific though. Each of my pairs have brought something good to the table and I see potential in each of them. Why would I ever want to come across in a vague and hateful way? That doesn't help anyone.<br><br>
    I've received a lot of feedback. Some of it wasn't very useful, some was confidence boosting, and some gave me pause. I take my feedback and keep it in mind for my future pairing sessions. We're there to help each other and if I see a trend where that isn't true, I'm going to do my best to rectify it.<br><br>
    From my feedback, my pairs tend to notice that I don't ask for more time when I'm trying to grasp a concept. I'll allow them to move forward and hope to catch up along the way (which usually happens). I think my priority is time and if I see that I'm taking a lot of it to fully understand something, I'd rather take a note of it and research it on my own time than hold up our session. Maybe if I'm more vocal about that during the session, my pairs won't be put off by my insistence to move forward.<br><br>
    Pairing has a lot of benefits. Not only are we getting to work with others that are in the same shoes and are approaching the same problems, but we're learning from each other and adding a sense of being in a classroom during this time of home study. I wish that we had a set schedule and that pairing didn't depend on our hunting and searching for pairs and times, because I'm having difficulty finding my second pair every week. I'll try to be more proactive early in the week.<br><br>
