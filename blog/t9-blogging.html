    The image above is my starting point. I created that page last fall, when I was first learning HTML & CSS. The image on the right wouldn't show completely on the page. Not all of the links worked. The contact and bio pages were non-existant.<br>
    <br>
    Now, as I'm ending Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp, I've revisited my site:<br>
    Visit it here: <a href="../index.html">Brandi's site </a>
    <br><br>
    You might review it and think that I haven't changed much. I've just put my photo in a circle and added some content. You'd think that I haven't learned much. You'd be right. While I feel like I changed a lot, the final outcome doesn't show a lot of change. I've updated almost everything. The links now work, the images almost always show correctly. Honestly though, CSS takes a long time for me and at this point, I feel like the best thing for me (if I had time) would be to scrap everything and start over again.
    <br><br>
    I picture a clean, fun, professional, polished page. Making that a reality is a true struggle. Not only am I working with a language that punishes me over and over again, I'm trying to design a website - and I'm not a designer.
    <br><br>
    My goal was to have an image on the right hand side of each page. The positioning of the left hand side content didn't always allow that. Also, the scrolling of the content is inconsistant and I haven't the faintest clue why.
    <br><br>
    On top of that, I checked my site on several browsers and then when I had my boyfriend open the page on his computer, the images appeared perfectly, but only half of the time.
    <br><br>
    Again, it should just be scrapped.
    <br><br>
    Another goal for the future would be to incorporate the index stylesheet with the individual blogposts. Right now, you click on a blog post title and it takes you to an uninteresting separate page. It's incohesive and looks amateur. Hopefully I'll get the chance to revisit it further along during DBC (as long as I've received further instruction).
